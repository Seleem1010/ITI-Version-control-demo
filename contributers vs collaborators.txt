Collaborators:
Collaborators on a personal repository can pull (read) the contents of the repository and push (write) changes to the repository.
You can add unlimited collaborators on public and private repositories(with some per day limit restrictions). But, in a private repository, the owner of the repo can only grant write-access to the collaborators, and they canâ€™t have the read-only access.

Contributers:
When a user's set of email addresses is found in the commit history of a github repo, github marks that user as a contributor.

GH Enterprise docs seem to be consistent with contributors only being associated with email addresses.
