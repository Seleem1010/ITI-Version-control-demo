Collaborators:
Collaborators on a personal repository can pull (read) the contents of the repository and push (write) changes to the repository.
You can add unlimited collaborators on public and private repositories(with some per day limit restrictions). But, in a private repository, the owner of the repo can only grant write-access to the collaborators, and they canâ€™t have the read-only access.
contributers can have permissions to :
Fork the repository
Rename a branch other than the default branch
Create, edit, and delete comments on commits, pull requests, and issues in the repository	
Create, assign, close, and re-open issues in the repository	
Manage labels for issues and pull requests in the repository	
Manage milestones for issues and pull requests in the repository	
Mark an issue or pull request in the repository as a duplicate	
Create, merge, and close pull requests in the repository
Enable and disable auto-merge for a pull request
Apply suggested changes to pull requests in the repository	
Create a pull request from a fork of the repository
Submit a review on a pull request that affects the mergeability of the pull request	
Create and edit a wiki for the repository	
Create and edit releases for the repository	
Act as a code owner for the repository
Publish, view, or install packages
Remove themselves as collaborators on the repository

Contributers:
When a user's set of email addresses is found in the commit history of a github repo, github marks that user as a contributor.

GH Enterprise docs seem to be consistent with contributors only being associated with email addresses.
